Edit test.rb, it is already setup to run unit tests based on MiniTest::Unit 

You can replace MiniTest::Unit by Test::Unit by installing the gem , using
Test::Unit::TestCase instead of MiniTest::Unit::TestCase and removing
the line 
MiniTest::Unit.autorun

Enabling Test::Unit also allows you to use redgreen (but you must use 
Test::Unit for redgreen to work)

Use ruby test.rb to run
